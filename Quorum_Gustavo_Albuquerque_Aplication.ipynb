This is because you already have the data processed and only need to aggregate it conveniently for visualization, and Power BI is well-suited for this role. Additionally, I am of the opinion that if a less technical tool meets the demands of the task, we should prefer it. It not only facilitates maintenance but also simplifies the hiring process.\n",
